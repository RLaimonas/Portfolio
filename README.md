# Welcome To My Portfolio

Link: https://rlaimonas.github.io/Portfolio/
## Introduction

Initially, I created this as a personal repository to collect information from my various projects that is otherwise scattered. It's a tool for me to quickly recall and refer to my past works. However, as the development progressed, I realized its potential as a platform to publicly showcase my skills and knowledge. Hence, I decided to make it accessible to all.  

As someone who primarily focuses on areas outside of web development, you may not find advanced animations or complex interactive elements here. This space is created to provide insights into my work, my learnings, and my journey in the world of technology and design.  

Here, you’ll find a collection of various projects I’ve been involved in. The portfolio includes a mix of both major and minor projects.

## Status

 This portfolio is a work in progress. I am in the process of retrieving archives of my older projects to include here. Moving forward, my intention is to update this page in real-time as projects progress, rather than after their completion – though the feasibility of this approach remains to be tested:)
